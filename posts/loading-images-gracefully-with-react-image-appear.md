Believe it or not, progressively loading images tend to degrade the overall user experience of a web application. And this can be more concerning for applications that rely heavily on high quality images. To fix this issue, a common technique is to display a placeholder image (for a short span) and replace it with the original image once it has loaded completely.

In this blog post we'll be looking at a React JS based component called [react-image-appear](https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/react-image-appear), which applies this very same technique and helps in loading images smoothly!

Smooth image loading with react-image-appear

## What is react-image-appear ?

It is a React JS component which makes images appear with transition as they load. It basically wraps an image within a placeholder element and adds a gif loader in between.

## Usage

Firstly the component needs to be [installed using npm or yarn](https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/react-image-appear#installation). Using it in your codebase is pretty straightforward, simply import the component and provide the requiredÂ **src**Â prop with any of the available optionalÂ props.

## Props

Apart from the required **src** prop there are various optional props that can be used to customise the image loading experience provided by react-image-appear. You can have custom loaders, placeholders, animations etc.
